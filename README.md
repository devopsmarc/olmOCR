# olmOCR

olmOCR is an open-source tool designed for high-throughput conversion of PDFs and other documents into plain text while preserving natural reading order. It supports tables, equations, handwriting, and more.

olmOCR has been trained on academic papers, technical documentation, and other reference content, and uses a unique prompting technique to increase accuracy and decrease hallucinations. The current model was fine-tuned on English documents; other languages are not likely to work.
